# Covid-19-Vaccination-Viz
Tableau Dashboard showing vaccinations data throughout the United States

The objective of this project was to create a visualization to see how effective each state's vaccination rollout plan was. With this dashboard we are able to visualize how many people were partially vaccinated and how many people become fully vaccinated within a certain time frame. The data goes back all the way from 12/20/22 to 2/1/2023 which is when the data was last updated when making this project.
